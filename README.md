1. Connected to the Raspbian terminal, browser to the directory:

cd Desktop/GoPiGo/Software/Python/Examples/Browser Streaming Robot/

2. Make the robot_web_server program as executable:

sudo chmod +x robot_web_server.py

3. Start the robot_web_server.py to start streaming the video from the camera module:

sudo ./robot_web_server.py

4. Now open the browser and enter dex.local:98 in the browser and hit enter to start streaming. Youâ€™ll also see some activity in the terminal.
