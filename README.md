# Autonomous Surveillance Robot

This code calculate the optimal path for a hardcoded given map (fixed obstacles) using A* algorithm. The path finding output is used to calculate the direction and move the Gopigo3/Raspberry pi 3 Robot. The ultrasonic sensor is responsable to detect moving objects and alert the operator.

In order to use the project, just clone it and execute asr.py file using py
